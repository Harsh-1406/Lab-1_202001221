**Q.1: Identify FRs and NFRs**

The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.

ANS:

**Functional Requirements:**

                        1)The user has to login in to the site for borrowing or issuing the book.

                        2)The user doesn't need to login for just viewing the book or wondering through the site.

                        3)There should be a registration process for a non member to becom member.

                        4)The book is borrowed for the finite time and it has to be returned after a period of a given time and these things shouble be updated time to time in user's account as well as in the librarian 's account.

                        5)There should be  searching options and filters for different genres of book.

                        6)There should be a facility of reissuing the book and extending the borrowing period.

                        7)There should be more facilities(like they have more borrowing period etc.) for the members.

                        8)Returning of the book and the updates regarding it should be reflected on the web page.
                        
**Non-Functional Requirements:**

                            1)Usability : It should be accesible all the time.

                            2)Performance : The site shouldn't get shutdown or get crashed due to large trafficking.

                            3)Concurrency : It can handle a large number of users at the same time.

                            4)Security : The site should be accessible within the institute LAN.

                            5)Security : The passwords (or confidential data) should be stored in star characters at the backend side(i.e. in the database)

                            6)Scalability : It has  to  be  developed  as  a web site or portal or application,  which  should  work  with Firefox 5, Internet Explorer 8, Google Chrome 12, Opera 10.

                            7)Maintainability : The site is easy to maintain and to update the things.

                            8)Flexibility : It should be user-freindly.





**Q.2.** Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

ANS:

**Scope:**

      1)The scope of developing a solution to this problem is to create a mobile application that addresses the everyday needs of people with disabling hearing loss.

      2)The application will use artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies. 

      3)The app will be optimized for Android devices and will work in real-time with low-latency.

**Features:**

        1)Recognition of key sound events of interest to the hearing-impaired community, such as car horns and babies. 

        2)Immediate alerts when key sound events are detected. 

        3)Continual logging of sound events for the user. 

        4)Optimized for Android devices with low-latency for real-time use.


**Non-functional aspects:**

                      1)Performance:To ensure that sound events are identified and logged in real-time, the app should have a quick response time and high throughput. 

                      2)Concurrency: The solution is ought to be able to handle several users and loud events. 

                      3)Security: The application should hide confidential data about user like password, etc and ensure that the data is kept confidential. 

                      4)Usability: It should be easy to use and navigate for users with disabling hearing loss. 

                      5)Availability: The app should be accessible to the intended audience 24x7. 

                      6)Maintainability: The app should be easily updated and maintained. 

                      7)Reliability: The app should be reliable and produce accurate results.

                      8)Scalability : This app should work on all kind of operating systems.
